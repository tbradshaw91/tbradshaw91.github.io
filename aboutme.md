My background is in business, fashion and beauty, although I have always had an interest in technology and Aerospace. After being exposed to a tech startup environment, I realized what I had been missing. Thus, I began my own tech journey. I started reading everything I could get my hands on, in addition to playing around with coding before I finally decided to commit to my education. I chose Data Science, because I would love to ultimately work with AI in the Aerospace industry and I believe Data Science is the the key to advancing our position in the global space race.
